            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As concerning the firſt finding out of the <hi>Magnet-ſtone,</hi> whereof I am to treate, <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Nicander</hi> haue fained that a certaine Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being in the fields, hauing his ſhoes ſhod with iron, and his ſtaffe armed with an iron pike, and reſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon a quantity of this ſtone, could not eaſily remoue his feete, or lift vp his ſtaffe, whereupon he perceiued the attractiue vertue of this ſtone, that it did attract and hold iron. Other thinke that the pioners and diggers of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, by their diligence and obſeruances firſt found out the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> and his vertue of attracting iron, by which property it was well knowne to the auntient <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Graetians</hi> in times paſt. Some haue thought that the
<pb facs="tcp:1722:3"/>
               <hi>Magnet</hi> would leeſe this quality attractiue, if he were annointed with garlicke, or touched with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and of this opinion were <hi>Ptolomie, Plutarcke, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſta Porta;</hi> for this mallady <hi>Ruelius</hi> hath found a remedy to annoint the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> with Goates bloud, and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> with his oyle of <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> will not onely cure him of this euill, but can make him ten times ſtronger then he was before, likewiſe <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> and <hi>Alexander Amphrodiſeus</hi> haue laboured to nouriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Magnet</hi> with fitings of iron and ſteele.</p>
            <p>Many haue ſtriued much to inquire out the cauſe how the <hi>Magnet</hi> ſhould attract iron vnto it, <hi>Epicurus, Aphrodiſeus, Carus, Iohannes Coſtaeus, Plutarke,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> do ſuppoſe this attractiue vertue to proceed from certaine motes, vnſenſible parts or vapors iſſuing forth of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> and entring into the iron by conuenient figures, and in their retiring backe againe do attract the iron to the <hi>Load-ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Fernelius</hi> haue thought the cauſe of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction to be Diuine and from aboue. <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> ſay that the <hi>Magnet</hi> hath life in it, whereby it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth the like ſubſtance as liuing things do. Some thinke that there is a certaine ſympathie betweene the <hi>Magnet</hi> and iron, as betweene the male and female, as <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius</hi> haue ſung.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auaroes, Scaliger,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus</hi> would haue iron to moue vnto the <hi>Magnet,</hi> as to his beginning and matrixe, from whence he came. <hi>Gulielmus Putea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Galen,</hi> and others, do iudge that by his ſubſtantiall forme he draweth iron vnto it, but Doctor <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whoſe labours are the greateſt, and beſt in <hi>Magneticall</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, doth conceiue that the <hi>Magnet</hi> and iron do moue one vnto the other, not by any ſpecificall forme, but from the
<pb facs="tcp:1722:3"/>
eſſentiall forme of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſſentiall part of the ſame, which is not ſo, as it ſhall be demonſtrated in the laſt Chapter of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this vertue of attraction in the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Serapio</hi> and the Moores, like farre trauellers, haue reported that in the <hi>Indies</hi> there be mighty craggie rockes, all of <hi>Magnet-ſtone,</hi> that will ſtay the ſhips as they ſaile by them, and pull the iron nailes out of them; this ſtory <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> alſo confirmeth to be ſo in the North, and that there, leaſt the rockes of <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> ſhould pull the iron workes and nailes from the veſſels and boates, they build them with wodden pins, and ſowe the boords together with lines of the barkes of trees; which indeed they do both for want of our skill in building ſhips and barges, and for want of iron workes, whereof they haue little ſtore.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this ſtone hath vertue to attract, therefore <hi>Marbodeus</hi> a French-man, <hi>Petrus Bairus, Pictorius</hi> and <hi>Arnoldus de villa noua</hi> do faine that this ſtone will pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure the loue of Princes and of women, and maintaine loue betweene husband and wife. <hi>Haly-abbas</hi> will haue the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> to cure the goute, if it be held in the hand, and the Eaſt Indians ſay that it preſerueth youth. <hi>Caelius Calcaginus</hi> ſaith, that if the <hi>Magnet</hi> be preſerued in the ſalt of the ſea-Lampron or Remora, that is thought to ſtay a ſhip vnder ſaile, that then the <hi>Magnet</hi> will draw vp gold that is fallen into the deepeſt well.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> teſtifieth that he hath ſeene a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> that would draw ſiluer vnto it, and chaſe iron from it. <hi>Cardanus, Antonius de Fantis, Petrus Perigrinus,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Taiſner</hi> do deliuer that there might be made a perpetuall motion by the vertue of the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> but by the experience of many ingenious practiſes I find it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
<pb facs="tcp:1722:4"/>
to be done.</p>
            <p>Since the finding out of the Sea-compaſſe, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300 yeares ago, by one <hi>Thomas Goa,</hi> borne neere <hi>Naples,</hi> or by <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</hi> who learned that skill in <hi>China,</hi> as is thought, and firſt brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> there haue growne many opinions how this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe ſhould be directed into the North and South. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius Ficinus, Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> thinke that the vertue of the conſtellation of the <hi>Beare</hi> doth gouerne the <hi>Magnet</hi> and iron, and therefore both theſe are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into the North. <hi>Petrus Peregrinus,</hi> Frier <hi>Bacon, Iohn Taiſner,</hi> and many other would haue the Compaſſe to obſerue the North pole: But ſince that <hi>Sebaſtianus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botta,</hi> did find out that the Compaſſe did vary from the true meridian, it hath bene imagined that there is ſome place in the heauens that the Compaſſe ſhould reſpect, as <hi>Cardan</hi> would haue it, to obſerue the ſtarre in the taile of <hi>Vrſa major. Beſſardus,</hi> a Frenchman ſaith that it doth behold the pole of the Zodiacke, <hi>Martin Corteſius</hi> would haue an attractiue point aboue the heauens, and <hi>Robert Norman</hi> an Engliſhman, denieth that there is an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue point, but affirmeth that there is a reſpectiue point, to the which the Compaſſe doth moue, eſpecially the <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory-needle,</hi> whereof he was the firſt inuent or.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liuius Sanulus</hi> ſuppoſeth that there is a certaine <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> meridian, and <hi>Francis Maurolicus,</hi> that there is a <hi>Magneticall</hi> Iland, and <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> holdeth that there be certaine <hi>Magneticall</hi> mountaines, which be ſet out in <hi>Plancius</hi> his Card, that the Compaſſe doth reſpect. But Doctor <hi>Gilbert,</hi> our friend and Collegiat, hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered theſe errors, and ſet forth the cauſes of the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Compaſſe in his booke <hi>De Magnete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet lately <hi>Gulielmus Nautonerius,</hi> a Frenchman, and
<pb facs="tcp:1722:4"/>
               <hi>Anthony Linton</hi> an Engliſhman haue ſuppoſed that the <hi>Magneticall-needle</hi> and Compaſſe do moue and turne themſelues vpon the <hi>Magneticall</hi> meridian alwayes vnto their owne <hi>Magneticall</hi> poles, placed vpon the ſuperficies of the earth that be neere, and within the circles polar, not varying at all from their owne meridian, but deuidte on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and decline from the meridians of the pole of the world, and with this conceit, theſe two, with many curious calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and proiects, will preſently find the longitude of all Cities and Countries; but this their ſtrong imagination hath failed them, being grounded vpon obſeruations from the variations of the needle, from which theſe two men haue ſet forth different <hi>Magneticall</hi> poles; and if they ſhould worke from 500 obſeruations, they might geſſe at neere halfe as many varietie of poles (for variations are not regular, but irregular, becauſe their ſcattered cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be irregular) ſo that theſe men haue found inſteed of the longitude of places, a longitude of vnprofitable labors.</p>
            <p>Therefore, not purpoſing to dazell any ones conceit with the repetition and confutation of any opinions, termes of Art, or words whatſoeuer, I will come to the Tractate it ſelfe, thinking that the quiuering <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call-needle</hi> will be trouble inough to handle for the better knowledge and delight in <hi>Magneticall</hi> experiments.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, I haue written thee a ſmall Diſcourſe as concerning <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Bodies and Motions,</hi> the which I hope will not be obſcure vnto thee through his breuitie, becauſe of his plaine method, and eaſie demonſtrations, which with their pleaſantneſſe will proue very ready and apparant vnto thee, eſpecially being animated from the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> ſtone it ſelfe, as from a moſt liuely and perfect tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: Therefore I would aduiſe thee, that when thou readeſt this booke, that thou wouldeſt prouide thy ſelfe of ſuch like formes of <hi>Magnets</hi> as I haue deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the firſt Table and figures of the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as alſo of needles, wiers, and waights of iron and ſteele, ſet forth in the ſecond Table of the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this booke, which thou mayeſt haue made and prouided for thee by the helpe of ſome skilfull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: when thou ſhalt be furniſhed with theſe kinds of prouiſions, then thou mayeſt reade and practiſe the operations and demonſtrations of this booke, which will be both eaſie and very pleaſant vnto thee; and though that there be many precepts and practiſes in this Booke, which be not for example ſake ſet downe in tables and figures vnto thy ſight, becauſe I deſired
<pb facs="tcp:1722:7"/>
to be very briefe, yet if thou ſhalt not be altogether vnskilfull in theſe demonſtrations that be delineated in the Tables of this booke and their often practiſe, thou wilt be able inough to vnderſtand and put them in vre, with theſe forenamed prouiſions. But if thou ſhalt deſire, beſides thy inſtruction in this kind of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to put in vſe and make benefit of theſe matters <hi>Magneticall,</hi> either in trauelling or ſailing vpon the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth, then it will be very neceſſary for thee to be ſtored with the Marriners Compaſſe for the ſea, perfectly drawne and framed, to know the way, and of what hand and point to ſaile and trauell, and alſo to haue the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in his ring, and a <hi>Directory-needle,</hi> or a little flie <hi>Magneticall</hi> in the boxe, faſtened at the bottome in his conuenient diſtance, for to know vnder what latitude thou art euery day of thy voyage: Likewiſe if I ſhould declare vnto thee how beneficiall the <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Magneticall-needle</hi> is for the deſcription of Ports, Hauens, Forlands, Capes, Bayes and Riuers, for the more perfect making of Sea-cards, how neceſſary for the poſiture of buildings, directing of dials, and all Mathematicall inſtruments for meaſuring and ſuruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for pioners and vnderminers of forts, for ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of minerals, mettals, ſea-coles, and other ſubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall bodies, I ſhould be too tedious vnto thee, and will rather referre thee for theſe matters to that which is ſet downe by others, becauſe I meddle here in this booke onely with thoſe things that be <hi>Magneticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this place I thinke good to aduertiſe thee as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the magnitude of the ſeuen Planets, with their reſpect vnto the earth, out of <hi>Ticho Brabe,</hi> deſcribed in the top of the Title Page; that whereas their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:1722:7"/>
cannot be ſet forth truly in any types, being at too great oddes: therefore I haue deciphered that in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; as let the <hi>Earth</hi> ♁ be but one part, the <hi>Sunnes</hi> ☉ greatneſſe will be 140 times ſo much; <hi>Saturnes</hi> ♄ 22, <hi>Iupiters</hi> ♃ 14. And if that <hi>Venus</hi> ♀ haue 6 parts, the <hi>Earth</hi> will haue 37 parts, if <hi>Mars ♂</hi> be one part, the <hi>Earth</hi> is 13, if <hi>Mercury</hi> ☿ be one part, the <hi>Earth</hi> is 18, if the <hi>Moone</hi> 
               <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> be one part, the <hi>Earth</hi> will continue her 42 times. Beſides, I haue drawne the <hi>Axis</hi> in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Planets, as being bodies <hi>Magneticall:</hi> for I truſt that theſe following times will diſcouer whether they be paralell one to the other, or no, as alſo what naturall motions elſe they haue, becauſe that <hi>Aſtra natant, auis inſtar in aëre, aut piſcis in vnda,</hi> and here it might be ſayd that we hope that many new points in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Aſtronomy will bloſſome and ſpring out of this kind of learning hereafter,</p>

                  <hi>Magnet,</hi> of a countrey in MACEDONIA ſo termed, where plenty of them are found, it is called <hi>Hercules</hi> ſtone, of a City of that name, and it is called the Iron ſtone of drawing it, we call it the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> the <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſtone,</hi> and the <hi>Oſmound ſtone</hi> in our Iron-mongers ſhops; becauſe of his leading directiue and attractiue qualitie, and it is well termed the <hi>Oſmound ſtone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is as it were <hi>Os mundi,</hi> the bone of the world: for by his vertue <hi>Magneticall</hi> he is like a bone and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar whereby this world and globe of the Earth is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained and ſupported in his iuſt ſituation, as the litle world of the body of man is ſupported by his bones.</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1722:10"/>
or little earth, becauſe that vpon this figure of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Magnet ſtone,</hi> we ſhall hereafter ſhew how to find naturally the poles and the reſt of the circles of the Spheare, prouing vnto your eyes all kinds of <hi>Magneticall</hi> demonſtrations on it, and ſhall after, moſt fitly and naturally, declare how to obſerue them in trauelling or ſailing vpon the great <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth. This forme may be artificially capped and armed with ſteele, or iron, at his two poles, <hi>Tab. I. Fig. 1. a. b,</hi> for to take vp iron waights, or to touch <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles withall.</p>
               <p>The next faſhion is a round and flatforme, of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thickneſſe like a coite, cake, halfe boule, Holland-cheeſe, or part of a columne, <hi>Table I.

               <p>The Oual and long forme like an egge, <hi>Tab. I.

               <p>You may cap and arme ſome kinde of formes of <hi>Magnets</hi> with foure teeth, two teeth from the ſide flatted at either pole, as we haue deſcribed <hi>Tab. I.

               <p>I haue drawne a line <hi>a b</hi> in all theſe formes, paralell to the <hi>axis</hi> of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> to the end that the caps of iron, croſſing the poles and <hi>axis a b</hi> at right angles, may be the better perceiued.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, in faſhioning of ſome <hi>Load-ſtones,</hi> the <hi>axis</hi> cannot ſo aptly be alwayes placed in the midſt of the ends of the <hi>Load-ſtones</hi> being flatted, vnleſſe there be a greater part of the <hi>Load ſtone</hi> taken away, &amp; the bulke very much deminiſhed, which will leſſen much the ſtrength of the ſtone: for the greater that the bulke is, the more is the ſtrength of the <hi>Magnet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I haue ſet downe a type in the laſt place, <hi>Tab. I.

Chapter of this Booke. Alſo by ſuch as haue made their courſe northerly and ſoutherly, it hath bin obſerued that the <hi>Magneticall Inclinatory-needle</hi> doth in euery eleuation of the pole conforme and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it ſelfe, or rather is conformed and diſponed vnto the <hi>axis</hi> of the Earth, according vnto certaine corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent angles to the Latitude, as it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the XII. XIII. XXXV. &amp; XXXVI. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Booke, whereby it is demonſtratiuely to be concluded, that the Earth is a <hi>Magneticall</hi> body, directing both her ſelfe and the other two <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> bodies into the North and South, by the vertue of her Meridian circles and parts, as is demonſtrated in the IX. chap. and others.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Earth hath naturally two <hi>Magneticall</hi> poles, vnto the which theſe meridionall parts do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1722:14"/>
bend &amp; force, not only <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies neere the Earth; but alſo her owne mighty and maſſie ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtability and firmeneſſe, and feateth her ſelfe ſo ſtrongly vpon her two poles, by her naturall and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> vigor, paſſing from her meridionall parts to the poles, as if ſhe were tied by many mighty ſtrong cables vnto two moſt firme pillars, farre ſtronger then any <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars, not to be remoued by any force from her naturall poſition; which thing, if it might chance that it ſhould come to paſſe, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſhe would returne againe vnto her former firme ſeate and place, as all <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies and directory needles do, as is demonſtrated hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus we proue that the Earth is placed and firmed by her <hi>Magneticall</hi> vertue, and not by her grauity and waight, though that the parts of the Earth do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne and adhere together by their grauity mouing to their Center. But the <hi>Magneticall</hi> nature moueth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth, and firmely ſeateth it ſelfe to the poles and <hi>Axis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for that the poles of the Earth do alwayes, by their natural vertues hold the Earth North and South in one certaine and vniforme ſituation, eleuation and place, there is no doubt but that the whole globe of the Earth, inwardly ſtored with many materials and rich minerals, &amp; outwardly adomed with many trees and excreſcences, all for the vſe of man, with liuing creatures innumerable, as alſo in reaſon it is an vnfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty, that the Earth hath, at her firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſtowed vpon her a globous and ſtarlike vigor, or intelligence, whereby ſhe may, hauing her whole parts vnited together, by the vertue of grauity vnto the center, and her place made ſure <hi>Magnetically</hi> by her
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1722:15"/>
poles vnmoueable; yet moue naturally, keeping her place circularly &amp; diurnally out of the Weſt into the Eaſt, to the end that all creatures ſhould receiue the comfortable and liuely beames of the Sunne, and the influences of the reſt of the Planets and Starres.</p>
               <p>This motion many learned men haue attributed vnto the Earth, for the benefit of calculating the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Planets the better, which naturally ſhe hath in her ſelfe; for euen as it were needleſſe for a wheele to haue her naue, ſpokes and rimme about her, if it ſhould not be vſed to turne about; ſo it were to no purpoſe that the Earth ſhould naturally haue a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous body, two poles, an <hi>axis,</hi> meridians and aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as ſhall be demonſtrated hereafter, parts fit for circular motion, and not for to turne her aequator and paralels about, as the wheele doth.</p>
               <p>Although theſe arguments will hardly perſwade vs to beleeue the earths motion; yet becauſe that it is late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued vnto our ſences by helpe of the truncke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectakle, both by <hi>Galileus</hi> and <hi>Kepler,</hi> famous Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matitians, that the great body of the globe of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> being twelue times greater then the Earth, doth turne about in leſſe time then a day vpon his <hi>axis</hi> and poles, who alſo haue obſerued foure Moones, attendant on <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which moue round about him, the ſloweſt in 14 dayes, the next in ſeuen dayes, and the reſt in ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time. So likewiſe <hi>Iohn Fabricius</hi> hath obſerued, that the great globe of the Sunne, hauing three great ſpots, like continents in him, and being ſixty times greater then the Earth to moue about his <hi>axis</hi> and poles neere the time of ten dayes, or there abouts, ſo <hi>Galileus</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> haue ſeene the Planet of <hi>Venus</hi> to moue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sunne in ten moneths, and to haue her light
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1722:15"/>
from the Sunne in this time increaſed and diminiſhed vpon her body, as we ſee the Moone here neerer vnto vs to haue; therefore it being certaine by obſeruation, that the globe of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the Sunne do turne about their <hi>axis</hi> and poles, whoſe materials we know not, we need not doubt that the Earth ſhould haue a circular motion for her great good. But how the Earth doth turne circularly we cannot well ſee it, with the ſence of our eyes, vnleſſe we had them placed in another glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous body and ſtarre, as if they were in the Moone, where we might ſee the ſpots of the Earth to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as well as now we ſee the ſpots in the Sunne, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> to moue circularly in their place. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe our eyes here on the Earth do ſee that the Moone doth not turne about, by the placing of her ſpots, alwayes in one faſhion vnto vs: for we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue with our eyes, that the Moone hath poles of a kind of <hi>Magneticall</hi> nature, which do alwayes hold her to behold the center of the Earth, and ſo ſtayeth and conformeth her, that howſoeuer ſhe moue, higher or lower, or whereſoeuer ſhe be, yet alwaies the ſpots of halfe her globe be alike apparant vnto our eyes, and conforme her to behold the center of the Earth with one pole: neither doth the Moone turne about her body vpon two poles, as the Earth doth vpon hers, but is kept firme and vnmoueable from circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about her <hi>axis,</hi> by other two poles that be vpon the edges and aequator of her body, becauſe her ſpots be alwayes alike on her Eaſt and Weſt ſide, that hold her firmely &amp; ſtiffely that ſhe can by no meanes turne about vpon her firſt two poles: For it is the vertue polar and <hi>Magneticall</hi> that holdeth all globes in their poſition whatſoeuer. Beſides, the Moone hath
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1722:16"/>
another vertue giuen her at her firſt creation, whereby beholding alwayes the center of the Earth, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neerer and further from the Earth, as tied with an axletree, ſhe moueth, ſlideth, and paſſeth moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Zodiacke, that all the parts of her globe may be illuminated and refreſhed with the beames of the Sunne, and influences of the Starres: for as a ſhip vpon the water is directed euen forward by the ſterne and ruther, which hath not only a right line to direct forward, but alſo a right angle deſcending downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that ſhe waue not ſidelings or turne about; yet hauing this poſition, if ankors be layd out, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or backward, or ſidelings, with their cables on boord, if there be force or vertue on boord to hale forward, ſhe moueth forward, if drawne backward, ſhe goeth backward, if pulled by the cable on the left hand, yet keeping her poſition, ſhe betaketh to that hand, and ſo to other parts. Euen ſo the Moone being ſeated, as afore is ſaid, doth moue on her <hi>axis,</hi> higher or lower, on this ſide or on that, according to the vertue &amp; ſtrength of the multiplicity of her axletrees, being her limbes to ſtay and moue withall, as the body hath armes and legges, with variety of muſcles to moue on all hands.</p>
               <p>But the Earth, whereon we liue and trauell, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene found by any to haue any poles in the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of her body, or neere the ſame: for if we were ſo happy to find any in the Eaſt or Weſt of the earth, then the matter of longitude would be perfectly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto, which hath ſo greatly buſied all the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious wits of the world: and therefore we affirme that the Earth doth turne about, becauſe there are no poles in the aequator to hinder her, as there is in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1722:16"/>
Moone from circular motion. But leauing theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to others that do labour more therein, here in this booke I purpoſe onely to intreate of the great globe of the Earth, as ſhe is a <hi>Magneticall</hi> body, which ſhall be firſt performed, by way of imitation, in a little <hi>Magneticall</hi> earth, or <hi>Terrella</hi> and <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> made of a round <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and Adamant, whereby we ſhall plainely and ſenſibly demonſtrate, that there be two poles, an <hi>axis,</hi> meridians, paralels, and an aequator in euery <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and <hi>Magnet,</hi> and we ſhall produce many other pleaſant demonſtrations, manifeſt The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oremes, and ſenſible practiſes vnto your eyes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which we ſhall after illuſtrate to be in the globe of the Earth, to proue it to be a third <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> body, different in ſubſtance from the other two <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, ſpoken of in the two former Chapters.</p>

               <p>I will firſt proue how the two poles are found out in the <hi>Magnet</hi> ſtone, which are very neceſſary to be knowne, before that the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> be faſhioned into any forme, for the better proportioning of the ſame; and this matter may be accompliſhed ſixe or ſeuen manner of wayes.</p>
               <p>The firſt way is to role the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> in ſmall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cleane filings of iron, and about thoſe parts where the points and poles be, there the filings will cleane faſt in great multitudes, and at the pole will ſtand and be erected vpright, marke theſe places with Chalke, Tripoly, Red-oker, or with an hard file for the poles.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is to hang a ſowing-needle by a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thrid, or a ſmall wier, <hi>Tab. II. Fig. 3</hi> 14. or as in <hi>Table III.

                  <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies haue two poles or points, the one is North, and the other is South, which be knowne either by hanging a <hi>Loadſtone</hi> leuelly in a third, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in a wodden diſh to ſwim in a baſen of water, and then the one Pole will alwaies turne to the North,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1722:19"/>
and the other to the South, which are to be marked accordingly.</p>
               <p>But whether that Pole that ſeateth it ſelfe South or North may be termed by that part which it reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſome haue laboured much to cleare. If you chance to find out the rocke where the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> doth grow, where you purpoſe to take out a part of the ſame, marke your part with notes for the North and South, then cut out your peece out of the rocke, and put it into a bole to ſwimme on the water, and your markes will be turned to a contrary ſituation, to that they had in the rocke, and the North note will be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned South, and the South North, and ſo would the rocke of the great <hi>Magnet</hi> it ſelfe, if it were ſo placed, make the like alteration in his ſituation, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conformation and direction of the mighty <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> the globe of the Earth. Therefore the reaſon why that the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> in the boat vpon the water, turneth, bendeth, and ſeateth it ſelfe to a contrary ſituation, to that he receiued and had primarily, whileſt he was in the bowels of the Earth, and vnited with the body of the great <hi>Magnet,</hi> is becauſe that euery peece and part of a <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> being ſeperated from the whole where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was a part, is now become a perfect, complete, and ſole <hi>Magneticall</hi> body, and is as it were, a little earth of it ſelfe, hauing all the proprieties <hi>Magneticall</hi> that the great Earth hath, as his two poles, meridians, aequator, and ſuch like: and therefore according vnto the nature of <hi>Magneticall</hi> vnion, hereafter ſpoken of in the XXII. chapter, will in no wiſe indure, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuffered to match and ſeate it ſelfe as he did before, but thinketh it more naturall, and a thing of more perfection and conueniency to turne his aſpect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1722:19"/>
a contrary way, to that he had primarily at his firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and endowement with <hi>Magneticall</hi> vertue.</p>
               <p>This alteration of polity is to be obſerued likewiſe in <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles, and long peeces of iron that be touched, and animated, and adhere to that part of the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> which ſeateth it ſelfe North, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at liberty and ſeperated from the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> will turne that part and end that was touched at the North pole, and ſeate it alwayes in the South, and it ſhall be ſufficient for vſe to know and marke with a note which is the North-pole of your <hi>Magnet,</hi> and which is the South-pole.</p>
               <p>There is another vertue in the Poles of the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> and that is, that the South-pole turned downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will take vp more then the North-pole will, and the North pole will erect a greater waight th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Poles which be in the great <hi>Magnet</hi> of the globe of the Earth, haue a maruelous ſtrong <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> power imparted vnto them, that they cannot be turned either higher or lower, or moued to the right hand or to the left, but hold the Earth continually in a true and certaine poſition and place, and would if any force or power ſhould moue their great ſtrength awry from the true ſyte and meridian latitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their right ſyte and place againe, and this is the true vertue of the Poles of globes, which the Sunne and <hi>Iupiter</hi> haue as well as the Earth.</p>

Theſe Poles be moſt certaine and ſure markes for all <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, conueniently caried to direct themſelues vnto, <hi>Tab. III. Fig.</hi> 9. as appeareth by our Compaſſes, which in all places of the world turne their Lilly into the North, whereby the Marriner knoweth what courſe to take. And the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Pole, &amp; Poles of the world, both articke &amp; antarticke, are all one and not diuerſe, as ſome haue imagined, which haue loſt both their oyle and their paines; and this is true, by the demonſtrations and motions of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle,</hi> although there be many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary cauſes of variation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Poles hold the Earth certainely in her polar poſition, while ſhe turneth her ſelfe about to receiue the Sun-beames, and influences of the ſtarres and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, for the generation and maintenance of all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior bodies, vpon her, in her, &amp; proceeding out of her.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, theſe Poles of the Earth, in certaine great number of yeares, haue naturally a little inclination in the polar circles of the Zodiacke, for the receiuing and moderation of the beames, lights, and influences of the ſtarres, whereby the progreſſions and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the aequinoctiall, and the mutations of the greateſt declination of the Sunne are perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to preuent the faining of many Spheres aboue the ſtarres, as the ninth, tenth and eleuenth, and their impoſſible motions.</p>
               <p>In faſhioning the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> it is conuenient to make flat or roundiſh the ends of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> where the Poles are the better to cap and arme them with iron or ſteele, to lift vp their conuenient waights, <hi>Tab.

next to the <hi>Terrella</hi> or <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> the meridian circle of the altitude of the pole; the outward externall ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle <hi>F H G,</hi> we will terme the meridian Inclinatory ſemicircle, becauſe the needle Inclinatory doth ſhew in theſe quadrants certaine parts and degrees, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to euery degree of the eleuation of the pole, of the <hi>Terrella,</hi> or <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> declared in the inner qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants of altitudes of the pole.</p>
               <p>For practiſe hereof, if it be deſired to know where the pole is eleuated ten degrees aboue the Horizon, what degrees the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> will point at in the Inclinatory meridian ſemicircle anſwerable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

               <p>The celerity of motions, attractions, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities within the <hi>Magneticall</hi> orbe is according to the goodneſſe of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> the greatneſſe of his bulke, conueniency of his figure and ſmoothneſſe, and in the ſhortneſſe of the diſtance in the aire, or in water; yet further then in theſe the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> extendeth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by contaction and continuation in a long wier ſet vnto his pole, which wier will moue a needle, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to another wier at the end of his length; but this is done by augmentation of the <hi>Loadſtones</hi> vigor, as ſhall be declared.</p>
               <p>Although that ſuch ſubſtances, which be not <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall,</hi> be placed betweene the needle and <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> yet they cannot hinder the orbe and proceeding of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> vigor, as if a <hi>Loadſtone</hi> ſhould be incloſed in a boxe of wood, ſtone, tinne, ſiluer, or braſſe, yet the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> will extend his <hi>Magneticall</hi> orbe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many pretty and ingenious <hi>Magneticall</hi> practiſes

               <p>Take a long <hi>Magnet</hi> that hath the poles in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, <hi>Tab. VII.

               </p>
               <p>Now I would haue you to prouide two long <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,</hi> that haue the poles in the middeſt, like that <hi>Tab. VII.

Moreouer, take other two <hi>Magnets</hi> that are long, with the poles in the ends, like that <hi>Tab. VII.

               <p>Now take away this ſecond ſtone, with the poles in the ends, &amp; turne it, and place the South end <hi>B,</hi> againſt the North end <hi>A,</hi> as <hi>Tab. VIII.

               <p>This is to be obſerued in theſe applications, that the neerer the ſecond <hi>Loadſtone</hi> is placed to the needles, in aſpect with the firſt <hi>Magnet,</hi> the better will they ſhape out theſe figures of applications, &amp; in the approching they will vary, by little and little, from their firſt ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vntill the vertue of the two <hi>Loadſtones</hi> be equall in their orbe.</p>
               <p>It may be imagined that theſe applications, for the moſt part, ſhould be found naturally vpon the earth in trauelling or nauigating betweene two great Ilands or high <hi>Magneticall</hi> continents, but the firſt &amp; fourth figure of this eighth Table cannot be found naturally in any place, <hi>Tab.

Semiterrella,</hi> or <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> and it will direct it ſelfe rightly vpon the meridian of the ſtone, as hath bene proued before, <hi>Tab. III. Fig. 9.</hi> but if you hold a little peece of iron toward the point of the needle, the point will flie from the iron, and deflect from his meridian a little. Yet let this peece of iron touch the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> and be vnited vnto it, and put it towards the needle a farre off, and the needle will turne from his meridian, and decline and vary towards it, the contrary is to be ſayd, if this iron be put towards the taile of the needle.</p>
               <p>Now take two long <hi>Magnets,</hi> that haue their poles in the end, and place a needle before the aequator of one of them, and it will apply paralell to the <hi>axis,</hi> then bring the other <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> and place the end where the pole is againſt the aequator of the firſt <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> as <hi>Ta.

               </p>
               <p>So alſo take two <hi>Loadſtones,</hi> and let one of them haue the poles in the middeſt, and the other in the ends, and you ſhall behold much artificiall variety of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one needle vnto them.

               <p>Alſo take rods of iron, wiers, and <hi>Magneticall</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, that haue neuer bin touched with the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> and rub them vpon the poles, caps, or teeth of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> at the ends, and they will be much refreſhed, vigorated, and animated with the polar and directory vertue at both ends, both of the North and South-poles, as though they had a new life of quickneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them, and theſe ſhall refreſh other needles that ſhall be touched with them, and apprehend and draw them away like captiues, and will not let them looſe from them, vnleſſe by force you ſeuer them.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to touch, incite, and giue the polar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory and <hi>Magneticall</hi> vigour and faculty vnto nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles &amp; Marriners compaſſes, is to rub them from the middeſt of the needle where the aequator of their <hi>axis</hi> is vnto their points vpon the pole, cap, or tooth of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> drawing them thus from their middle to the ends, vpon the cap, pole, or paralell neere the ſame,

               <p>It is doubted whether the touch and polar vertue wil be giuen as wel from a paralell ſome diſtance from the pole, as from the pole it ſelfe, it is plaine, that from thoſe paralels and parts, neere adioyning to the pole, the greateſt vigour of politie <hi>Magneticall</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, yet in paralels, neerer the aequator, it will be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe, &amp; the vertue directory will be very ſufficient.</p>
               <p>If you touch the needle amongſt the paralels, it is the beſt way to rub the needles alongſt the meridians towards the pole, rather then to rub the croſſe the meridians, in a paralell manner, yet this way will giue the polar and <hi>Magneticall</hi> vertue alſo.</p>
               <p>Some haue thought it better to touch compaſſes, and <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles, rather on the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> then vpon their caps, thinking that the vigor and faculty <hi>Magneticall</hi> will continue longeſt that is giuen from the bare <hi>Magnet</hi> ſtone, the truth is to be obſerued in time. Yet the cap and tooth giueth and imparteth a ſtronger vigour to the needles then the bare ſtone doth, becauſe the vertue of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> is increaſed as much by the armor and cap as if his bulke ſimply were tripled.</p>
               <p>Needles and wiers of ſteele, heated to an height, and reduced backe to a blewiſh colour, will receiue a ſtronger touch, and retaine it ten times longer then iron will, howſoeuer he be hardned, yet iron is beſt

               <p>That end of the needle, whether directory or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory, which is to be touched, ought to be ſomewhat lighter then the other, eſpecially for the North, and moſt vigorous touch end of the ſtone, becauſe that the touching will ſway downe a little, and the needle hath two motions, one of direction, the other of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and then the needles and compaſſes will play more leuell and aequidiſtant to the horizon for the ſayd vſes.</p>
               <p>When any <hi>Magneticall</hi> needle or wier is touched from the North-pole, or tooth of the Adamant, that end of the needle will reſpect the North-pole of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> but being ſeuered out of the orbe of the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, it will be directed into the South by the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> vertue of the earth.</p>
               <p>But if a round globe or ring of iron be touched with the North-pole of the ſtone, the place touched will haue the vertue of the South-pole, &amp; the North-pole will be in the oppoſit part, and being ſeuered from the <hi>Magnet,</hi> it will not turne to the contrary part, as it falleth out in long <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles &amp; compaſſes, as before.</p>
               <p>If a ring of iron be touched, the correſpondent pole will be in the oppoſite part, but if this ring be cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made a ſtraight wier, then both ends will haue the vigor of one pole onely.</p>
               <p>Excite a directory needle at both ends from one pole, and they will both be of one nature, and looke what point was laſt touched, and that will turne, as if he onely were touched, and direct more ſurely, with leſſe wauering too and fro, then the other touchings will, ſpoken of before.</p>

               <p>The firſt way is by faſhioning caps of iron or ſteele to either pole, as hath bene deſcribed, <hi>Tab. I.</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>This way or arming is moſt vſuall, for thoſe <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones</hi> that be of a long ouall forme where at the poles there is fitted and placed two concaue peeces of ſteele, which are faſtned and held cloſe to the ſame by three or foure long narrow plates of ſiluer or braſſe, not vnlike to that order which is vſed in tipping of cuppes with ſiluer, that be of Oſtridge-egges, Indian-Nuts, Mace-wood, and Stone, which from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to the verges and edging, haue ſiluer plates for to hold the edging and bottome together: ſome trimme their <hi>Load-ſtones</hi> all ouer with ſiluer, and guild both the ſiluer and the armour, ioyning altogether with pretty ioynts, as in a caſe to open and ſhut.</p>

               <p>There is a way to cap the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> ſo that it ſhall take vp with eight teeth, vſing foure at one time, and foure at another, the ſtone would haue two broad ſides where the poles are, and the teeth would bee in forme like a <hi>Romane</hi> X. or S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> croſſe the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hereof would be placed on the pole, and the teeth artificially faſtned.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1722:48"/>
The firſt is commonly obſerued to bee at the Poles, where one body <hi>Magneticall</hi> is conioyned and vnited vnto the other in a right line, vpon the <hi>axis</hi> at the pole <hi>Tab. XI. Fig. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtrong vnion falleth out when the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies where the pole is placed is made plaine, where at the edges, <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies adhere at right angles vnto the <hi>axis,</hi> as <hi>Tab. III. Fig. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</hi> and <hi>Ta. VII. Fi. 2.</hi> but more plainely, this ſtrong vnion appeareth when as the Adamant ſhall be capped with two teeth at either pole, deſcending at right angles vnto the <hi>axis,</hi> for here a tooth will lift vp as much perpendiculerly at right angles to the <hi>axis,</hi> as it will at the pole in a right line. <hi>Table XI. Figure 10. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſtrong vnion, and ſtrongeſt, is when at a Meridian in the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> there is a ſuperficies made flat and plaine, paralell vnto the <hi>axis,</hi> where the coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the conformity in the aequator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining neither to one pole, nor to the other, is moſt ſtrong, for whereas wyers and weights, at the pole, hang and adhere vnto it, but by one end onely, heere they will adhere alongſt their <hi>axis,</hi> leaping more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to adhere with their whole ſide and vnite, then they will from their endes vnto the poles, as <hi>Tab. III. Fig. 4.</hi> therefore the Adamant being armed artificially with two teeth, at right angles vnto the <hi>axis,</hi> will in this paralel-conformity vnto the <hi>axis,</hi> apprehend and lift vp weights heauier by many times, then the caps at the poles will, <hi>Tab.

               </p>
               <p>The weaker vnition of <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies together is in the other parts of the Meridians, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

and applications of their bodies is oblique to the <hi>axis,</hi> though that neere the pole, the oblique co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition is ſtronger then it is by the aequator, Notwiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there is an oblique coition, as ſtrong as the ſtrongeſt vnion, and will take vp as great weights, as the paralell vnition to the <hi>axis</hi> doth, and this is, as it were, a paralell coition alſo betweene the teeth and the head of the weight, yet oblique to the <hi>axis</hi> of the body of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> as <hi>Tab.

               <p>Vnition alſo, is either naturall, halfe violent, or elſe depraued; the naturall coition is when the vnion and conioyning of <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies is by the contrary parts, as in Adamants, by the poles North to South, and in needles by head and taile, as <hi>Tab. XI. Fig. 7. Tab. XII. Fig. 5. 6. 9.</hi> ſo two wyers ſwimming on their corkes in the water, being touched by contrary poles, will march and haſten to ſalute one the other, like two louers, <hi>Tab.

               <p>Now that vnition, which <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and excited at the pole of the Adamant haue, may bee thought to bee halfe violent and ſome-what ſtrange, <hi>Tab. III. Fig. 1. 6. 7. Tab. IIII. Fig. 1.</hi> becauſe that heere there is an affinity of two <hi>Magneticall</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſame nature and denomination, and not of the contrary, that it ſeemeth that the <hi>Magneticall</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, betweene the Adamant and the Iron, is both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from all other <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies and ſome-what imperiall; for it is not to be ſeene either in <hi>Magnets</hi> one towards the other, though they be of the ſame rocke and peece, or in any wyers of yron or ſteele of one towards the other, or in the earth it ſelfe, with thoſe that ſhe doth <hi>Magnetically</hi> animate, that that pole which is excited, or animated with a pole of the ſame nature, ſhould reſpect and conforme it ſelfe, being artificially, without renitency, carried vnto a pole of the ſame nature and denomination, from whence he receiued his firſt vigour.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, no doubt, the Adamant is Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line vnto his beloued the Iron and Steele, and theſe are Femenine, as more apt to obey, reſpect, and follow the Maſculine, ſubiect to be attracted by him, whoſe preſence quickeneth, reuiueth, and animateth them in all kind of vigor and commutation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when yron is vntouched, and vnexcited, the coition is the weaker, but when a ſmall peece of Iron ſhall be in a boate, with materials of other lading to be vnited to a <hi>Magnet</hi> in his veſſell, heere the coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is depraued and weake, becauſe the <hi>Magnet</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and draweth his owne beloued beſt, when ſhe is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1722:50"/>
not laden or mixed with materials that be of different nature not <hi>Magneticall,</hi> and for this cauſe the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant will take vp a greater weight, all of Iron or ſteele, then when a great weight of other ſubance, is faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a ſmall weight of iron or ſteele.</p>

               <p>And hauing before partly diſcouered the motions that <hi>Magnets</hi> haue with the earth, being taken out of the ſame, and bred, and animated therein, as alſo the motions of ſuch irons as haue bene excocted out of the mines, and ſuch like veines, or rather bones of the Earth, that haue bene alſo endued and excited with the directory and <hi>Magneticall</hi> vigour from the Earth, both at their firſt forging and forming, as alſo by their placing vpon the ground whileſt they coole, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tractable with our hands, and their poſition in houſes, windowes and other places.</p>
               <p>Alſo I haue ſhewed how this vertue directorie, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, vigour, and politie is to be giuen to compaſſes for the ſea, &amp; to directory needles, that direct our moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dials into the meridian line, and to the <hi>Inclinato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-needle,</hi> or any other needle or Mathematicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Now I am to declare how ſuch demonſtrations as haue bene learned at home out of the <hi>Terrella</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miterrella magneticall</hi> may be put in practiſe and vſe by ſuch as ſaile to farre countries by ſea, or trauell by land, for their great benefit, both to teach them how to direct their courſe, and to tell them in what place

and climate they are in, which thing they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and learne very perfectly, hauing the directory in their compaſſes, and the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> in the meridian ring artificially made about them.</p>
               <p>In comparing the two <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies of iron, and the <hi>Magnet</hi> with the earth, the great and mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>Magnet</hi> of all <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, we ſhall ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that not onely in the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> the <hi>Terrella</hi> and <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> but principally in the great <hi>Terra</hi> and <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the Earth, there is naturally found the two poles, the North and South, the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the meridians, paralels, axis, and horizon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the motions and concluſions that haue bene made vpon the meridians of the ſayd formes in the <hi>Magnet,</hi> are proportionably and agreeably to be found in the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth, in paſſing about her meridians, for all <hi>Magneticall</hi> motions are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpon the meridians principally, as hath bene ſaid. Therefore place any <hi>Magneticall</hi> body, as is vſed to be done, free from all obſtacles, <hi>Tab. XI. Fig.</hi> 5. 6. that may hinder their motion and conformity, and they will be ſituated conformably vnto the meridian of the earth, becauſe that the earth hath primarily, naturally, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her firſt creation, all <hi>Magneticall</hi> faculty, vigour, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, and potency in her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And firſt if a <hi>Magnet</hi> whoſe poles are knowne by the Art before taught, be placed in a boate, or boule of wood, and put into a great baſon or boule of water, it will conforme, direct, and ſeate it ſelfe North and South, according to the ſame poſition and meridian that paſſeth directly vnto the poles of the earth; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take a <hi>Magneticall</hi> needle that hath bene excited with the Adamant, ſuch as be in moueable dyals, or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1722:55"/>
elſe take the Marriners compaſſe, and place them in quiet ſituation, and they will be directed by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vertue and <hi>Magneticall</hi> vigour of the earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, and Southpoles vpon the true meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian circle and line, if there be no obſtacle.</p>
               <p>All direction is obſerued by <hi>Magnetical</hi> bodies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the directory-needle and compaſſe vpon one certaine horizon, whoſe center is in a meridian cut by ſome of the paralels, and on this center the needle and compaſſe is ſuppoſed to be placed, being truly peaſed and compoſed, that they may play, turne too and fro, and reſt leuell and paralell vnto the horizon, fitly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon a pin of braſſe or ſiluer, and be well touched and excited, to the end they may be directed more certainely towards the poles vpon the meridian, <hi>Tab. XII. Fig.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Magneticall</hi> needles would be touched with a good vigorous and bigge <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> that being cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped lifteth vp at leaſt halfe a pound weight of iron, to the end it may carry the flie and card of the compaſſe more ſtrongly to his true direction and ſituation; all needles and compaſſes that are to be animated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with that part of the <hi>Magnet</hi> that ſeateth it ſelfe North, ſwimming in a diſh vpon the water, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent power of the earth, and being freed from out of the orbe and vertue of other <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, theſe are turned and directed by the vigor of the earth into the South vpon the meridian line.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo a rod of iron that ſtath bene placed North and South in a window a long time, whereby he hath receiued a true touch of polar vertue from the Earth, being within the orbe of his vigour, and being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from this poſition, which would be noted with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1722:56"/>
chalke, and hanging leuelly in a ſtring in the aire, will moue his North part, and ſeate it in the South quietly.</p>
               <p>Therefore all <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, whether it be the <hi>Magnet</hi> that is taken out of the Earth, or a part of a <hi>Magnet</hi> taken out from this ſtone, that was cut imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly out of the earth, or any iron or ſteele that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, either from the earth, from an Adamant, or from another excited needle, iron, or knife, or long forme of burnt clay, all theſe whatſoeuer receiuing their directiue and polar faculty from another <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> body, being ſet at liberty artificially in the aire or water, to moue and turne, will ſeate and be directed to the contrary pole they were firſt reuiued by.</p>
               <p>Euery part from the aequator to the pole doth giue a polar and <hi>Magneticall</hi> vertue vnto diuerſe formes of iron and ſteele to moue vnto a contrary poſition, by the directiue faculty of the earth.</p>
               <p>This faculty directiue is as ſtrong vpon the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as elſewhere, though it do not beſtow it to others, being fortified from both prouinces on either ſide, and when the needle and compaſſe ſhall be in the aequator of the earth, becauſe their libration and leuelneſſe is all one with the horizon: therefore here the direction is conformable and ſtrong: but in other places, and neere the pole eſpecially, the leuelling of the needles is more violent, becauſe they would incline and make an angle with the <hi>axis,</hi> and therefore the direction here is thought by ſome to be very weake: yet in this place neere the pole in the <hi>Terrella</hi> and <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> the little needle on his foote beareth himſelfe moſt ſtrongly and ſtiffely, that being with a finger turned awry, it will turne againe to his direction very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, though inclining to the ſtone, and reſt it ſelfe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1722:56"/>
very ſpeedily, without many turnings to and fro, ſo that neere the pole the direction is very ſtrong, neither by leuelling hindred.</p>
               <p>Alwayes and in all places the Lilly of the compaſſe or croſſe of the directory-needle ſtandeth and is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the North, both in this North ſide, and on the other South ſide of the aequinoctiall line or circle of the earth, <hi>Tab.

Fig.</hi> 13. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſyte of the needle neere the <hi>Terrella</hi> or <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrella,</hi> becauſe they are touched and excited at that point of the <hi>Load ſtone</hi> that in his boate reſteth South, and being ſet at liberty from the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> by the earth is turned North, as the point touched at the North-pole of the Adamant is turned South, neither needeth there here any conuerſion of the compaſſes in ſailing and going from one prouince of the aequator to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the needle idoth towards the <hi>Magnet</hi> being maſculine, and the needles of iron or ſteele feminine, but the needles to the earth are perfect <hi>Magneticall</hi> bodies, and do keepe their correſpondency with the earth, as if they were <hi>Magnet</hi> ſtones, or diameters of little earthes: therefore the needles and compaſſes paſſing from one ſide of the aequator to the other, in a meridian and great circle, proceedeth on ſtill in a right line vniformely, onely the points of the needles and compaſſes do take their turnes to be predominant in their direction in their owne prouinces, eſpecially if their leuel would ſuffer the vertue <hi>Inclinatory</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, which thing is moſt apparant by the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> in his ring, that being on this ſide of the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor erecteth his lilly aboue the horizon towards the pole, but on the further South ſide of the aequator dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his Lilly vnder the horizon, and ſuffereth the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1722:57"/>
Point to reſpect his owne pole with conuenient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles to the <hi>axis.</hi> But this thing cannot be done by the compaſſe and directory-needle, which lye alwaies pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel to the horizon, but onely is demonſtrable by the ſtone in the 4 and 5 tables before.</p>
               <p>This were a fit place, to ſpeake of the order of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Sea-Compaſſes, the inſtruments for <hi>Magneticall</hi> direction, the making whereof is very well knowne vnto Artificers, yet I could wiſh, that they were more artificially made then they are, though the price were ſome-what more, with ſome additions, which wee do partly touch in the Chapter following, and wiſh alſo that the points were 48. in vſe, that euery point might be halfe an hower.</p>
               <p>All direction is performed vpon the true Meridian reſpecting directly with the Needle the poles of the earth, as the Needle doth in the good and polliſhed <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> and <hi>Terrella,</hi> vnleſſe it be weakened, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and forced to decline from the true Meridian of the earth, by the cauſes of variation.</p>

But becauſe the Globe of the earth is knowne vnto vs, to bee very vn-euen and vn-equally mixed, with many materials, differing from <hi>Magneticall</hi> ſubſtance, hauing great and ſtony Mountaines, large Vallies, deepe Seas, long and high Continents and fore-lands, ſome with mighty ſcattered rockes of <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> of Iron-Mines, and other <hi>Magneticall</hi> matter, and ſome without, as alſo the entrailes, and interiour ſubſtance, barke or ſcarfe of the earth, conſiſting of a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſubſtance not <hi>Magneticall,</hi> whereupon it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that when the <hi>Magneticall</hi> faculty of the earth ſhall direct theſe <hi>Magneticall</hi> inſtruments of the Needle and Compaſſe, they are not compoſed or ſet directly vpon the true Meridian that paſſeth right on to the poles of the earth, but are drawne and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced awry towards ſome vigorous and <hi>Magneticall</hi> eminency of the earth, whereby the Meridian which the Needle and Compaſſe maketh doth decline and vary from the true Meridian of the earth, certaine parts &amp; degrees in the Horizontal circle, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the variation of the Compaſſe; the Meridian that this declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the compaſſe &amp; needle maketh, may be termed the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Meridian, to diſtinguiſh it from the true Meridian, and the ſpace betweene the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Meridian, and the true Meridian is the difference of variation; So that here the needle &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>For if the <hi>Magneticall</hi> eminency, whether it bee iron like clay, myne of iron, or rockeof <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> be contiguous vnto the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Globe of the earth and faſtened in the ſame ſubſtance vnto it, then the Compaſſe and Needle will leaue the direction of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Globe of the earth, and deflect towardes this eminency, but if this Mountaine <hi>Magneticall</hi> be not continued with the Globe, and haue other Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials vnder and about him, then the Needle and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe will be thruſt awry, and flye from it, declining as much, in a maner, the other way, leaning vnto it by the other point or taile, as it is demonſtrated in the rule of Application of one Needle, in his varrying vpon the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> vnto a peece of Iron, touching and not touching the ſtone.</p>

               <p>Where as the vigor and potency <hi>Magneticall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1722:59"/>
from the Equinoctiall to the poles of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Globe of the earth, as it doth in the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> whereby the like eminency <hi>Magneticall,</hi> in the parts neere the poles, be of more allicient and Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine property, then they are about the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, therefore it may bee thought, that in ſayling vpon one Meridian, in like diſtance, from this eminency, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with this vigour, it will make a greater variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Compaſſe neere the pole, then it doth neere the Equinoctiall, but this matter may bee helped and leſſened by the great vigour that the needle is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted withall from the Adamantine. Globe of the earth, eſpecially if the Seas bee ſhallow, and the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in a neere Orbe vnto the ſame, for thus the Needle will very hardly bee remoued, becauſe the force of the earth is great that directeth it, but marke that in the XXIII. chapter, where a ſmaller ſtrength <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> altereth quickely the retention of the whole more vigorous <hi>Magnet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo it is thought, that the variation of the compaſſe is much furthered by the naturall inclination of the needle and his conformity to an high-land, along the Meridian, betweene the aequator and the pole, like the demonſtration of the <hi>Tab. VII. Fig.</hi> 2. where the long <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> varieth the Needle from the Meridian by little and little to a right angle, ſo if it could bee found out, that a neere perticular cauſe were ſo potent to vary the needle, as the long-ſtone, there is the ſide of the land would vary much, but the cap farre more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the aequator, as in the <hi>Tab. VIII. Fi.</hi> 5. an eminent part of land, ending at the aequator, might vary the needle much, as is there demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Although theſe applications be great inducements
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1722:59"/>
that there ſhould be ſuch poſitions of the Compaſſe, in ſome places betweene vigorous lands, to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet becauſe that theſe eminences from land, are not any particular and complete <hi>Magnets</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but adherences and protuberances of ſome part of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Globe, and haue their nature according to the vigour of that paralell where they ſtand, and haue not euery one of them a pole neere their caps and angles, as theſe <hi>Magnets</hi> haue, in their demonſtrations ſet downe. I cannot wholy approue them for ſufficient demonſtrations of variation, though they may helpe very much for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for the better knowledge of the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Compaſſe by the <hi>Terrella,</hi> it is very conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to apply a ſtrong <hi>Magneticall</hi> body vpon the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> alongſt the Meridian, or a little obliquely, then carrying a little needle vpon the <hi>Terrella,</hi> the needle will vary more from the true meridian neere the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, then it will doe neere the pole, becauſe the Needle neere the pole is directed very ſtrongly and ſtiffely by thoſe parts, and will hardly bee forced from his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>But let the eminency bee very vigorous thicke, and about twenty degrees high, then hold the Needle ſo high from the <hi>Terrella</hi> in that Orbe, then the Needle is to be conueyed from the aequator to the pole, and firſt bring this eminence towards the Needle, and it will beginne to vary from his direction, being within twenty degrees or parts of the eminency, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his declination continually till hee bee varied towards ſixty degrees, in the parts neere the aequator, and about fifty degrees, at the moſt, in the parts neerer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1722:60"/>
the pole in the ſame Orbe, therefore the deeper that the Seas are, the greater is the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Orbe, and the more ſubiect to ſuffer the Needle to bee attracted by a neere eminency, and the ſhallower that the Sea is, the leſſe is the <hi>Magneticall</hi> orbe of the earth, which more hardly ſuffereth the Compaſſe to vary.</p>
               <p>This is to bee noted that high-eminences and lands neere the poles, being before the Compaſſe doe not cauſe the ſame to decline, but onely ſuch eminences as are placed according to the Meridians, and trent North and South, or obliquely a little on either ſide, to theſe the Compaſſe will be attracted awry from his true direction.</p>
               <p>But if there be a narrow paſſage betweene two high-lands, then the Compaſſe and Needle will reſpect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eminency, but carry and direct it ſelfe paralelly betweene them both, when the ſtrength of two high-lands is of equall force; as it is demonſtrated vpon the <hi>Terrella,</hi> and not vnlike to the figure, <hi>Tab. VIII. Fig.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>This is to be obſerued alſo, that the middeſt of an high-land, by demonſtration vpon the <hi>Terrella,</hi> doth attract moſt, and make the greateſt variation, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ends it decreaſeth by little and little, and once paſſing by the eminency it varieth the compaſſe no more, and it is likely ſo to do vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>If there be a <hi>Magneticall</hi> rocke lying ſidelings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water, it will make the needle vary a little from the true Meridian.</p>
               <p>Therefore the farther that the Compaſſe is diſtant from an high-land, that attracteth, the leſſe is the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and paſſing further out of the orbe of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there will be no variation at all, vnleſſe the deepes and ſubſtance of the earth bee partly <hi>Magneticall,</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1722:60"/>
partly of different ſubſtance, For theſe cauſes it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that places of a ſmall diſtance aſſunder do differ much in their variation, holding one proportion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in paſſing vpon a meridian, or on a paralell, yet in one and the ſelfe-ſame place variations neuer differ, but remaine certaine and conſtant.</p>
               <p>The Weſt-ſhore of a <hi>magneticall</hi> continent doth make the variation of the compaſſe Eaſterly, and the Eaſt-ſhore of a maine-land beholding the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing attracteth on the North-ſide of the aequator, the Lilly of the Compaſſe that it decline Weſt from the true Meridian, on the South-ſide of the Equinoctiall the point of the Needle is attracted, <hi>Table XIII. Fig.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>About the Ilands of <hi>Azores</hi> the Compaſſe hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle variation, as at <hi>Fayall</hi> the Compaſſe varieth to the Eaſt three degres, and at <hi>Coruo</hi> the variation of the Compaſſe foure degrees to the Weſt.</p>
               <p>Some thinke that Ilands, though <hi>Magneticall,</hi> make no variation, being too weake and feeble in regard of the great ſtrength of the directiue globe of the earth, which directeth the needle and compaſſe, becauſe that the Iland of <hi>Elba,</hi> neere <hi>Florence,</hi> being ful of <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,</hi> cauſeth no variation of the compaſſe more then other places neere adioyning do, but if vpon the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> as in the XXIII. chapter there be neuer ſo litle wiers applied neere a needle, it will deflect towards them, ſo that here perfect obſeruation may be deſired, which by the common rules is long and tedious to performe: therefore I will ſet downe ready and eaſie wayes to obſerue the true meridian by the Sunne, that the variation of the compaſſe may be plainely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that in a moment, by one obſeruation only,

to the end that induſtrious and skilfull pilots will in time furniſh themſelues and the world with the true obſeruation of variations in all parts of the world.</p>

               <p>Next place the foote of the compaſſe in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth degree of the quadrant, and ſtretching it to <hi>A</hi> deſcribe the arch of a circle from <hi>A</hi> to the arch <hi>F G,</hi> which being diuided into ninty parts, firſt into three parts, and theſe into three parts, againe draw a line from 20 in the quadrant to 20 from the arch <hi>F G,</hi> now make an obſcure line from <hi>E</hi> to the 20 degree in the quadrant, and from this line at 20 make an obſcure line for the horizon at right angles to <hi>E,</hi> 20, take the diſtance from <hi>E</hi> 20, and place it in the line 20 <hi>I,</hi> and from 20 as a center, the compaſſes being vnremoued, deſcribe the arch <hi>I M,</hi> cutting the line 20 and 20 into <hi>M,</hi> which is the angle the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> maketh with the horizon, and being ſet in the arch <hi>D B,</hi> the number of the degrees of this arch of inclination will appeare.</p>

               <p>Both by the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> it ſelfe, by the fundamentall hypotheſis, by inſtruments, and by tables; but becauſe that the globe <hi>Magneticall</hi> of the Earth hath many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities filled with other ſubſtances different from <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> nature, and many mountaines <hi>Magneticall</hi> mounted aboue theſe ſubſtances higher and lower, ſo that ſome attract, being aboue the point of the <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory-needle,</hi> ſome being vnder it; ſome placed before it, draw the point of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> vp vnto them, other behind it, beeing alſo adamantiue forts will haue this <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> ſtrike ſaile to them alſo, by which meanes the naturall conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> to his naturall angles is much diſturbed and depraued, whereby it commeth to paſſe that this needle hath his variation alſo, as well as the directory needle hath, as is before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
               <p>Therefore the variation of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> is,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1722:85"/>
when in one altitude of the pole this needle pointeth out another angle, different from the true and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent angle of that latitude of the pole, being hindred by a mountaine, or part <hi>Magneticall,</hi> that doth attract one of the points of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle,</hi> approching neere vnto it, either neere the poles or aequator, in ſo much that the angle of inclination is made leſſe or more then it naturally would be.</p>
               <p>In ſailing Eaſt or Weſt vpon a paralell, hauing hie land on the ſide towards the pole, conſiſting of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> ſubſtance, this will attract the <hi>Inclinatory-needle,</hi> and cauſe his naturall poſition to be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular then it would be.</p>
               <p>If the ſhore about the pole be ſituated betweene the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> and the aequator, this adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine eminency will attract the needle vnto it, making his inclination leſſe plumbe then naturally it is.</p>
               <p>In ſailing Eaſt or Weſt neerer the aequinoctiall, where the cariage of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> is leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, and more tending to the leuell with the horizon, the <hi>Magneticall</hi> eminency betweene the pole and the needle, will pull downe the higher end of the ſame, and make him more paralell to the <hi>axis</hi> of the earth, then naturally he could endure.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo an adamantine mountaine, betweene the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> and the aequinoctiall line, will lift vp the lower end of this needle, being within the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> vigor of that mountaine, and make him more paralell with the horizon then his naturall conformity requireth in that paralell.</p>
               <p>The variation of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> is greater in the parts neerer the aequinoctiall, then it is in the parts neere the poles, where this needle is not attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

ſo many degrees from his naturall angle, as vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he is neere the aequinoctiall.</p>

Chapter of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, <hi>Table VIII. Fig.</hi>1.</p>
               <p>In ſailing neerer the aequinoctiall in ſtraights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two adamantine mountaines, whoſe vigour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue ſurpaſſe the generall vertue diſponent of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth, theſe will lay the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatory-needle</hi> in a paralell and leuell to the horizon, though they be many degrees from the aequinoctiall, as Chapter XV. <hi>Tab VIII. Fig.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in paſſing or ſailing neere and ouer a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Magneticall</hi> rocke, in the ſea, or earth, vnder vs, in approching neerer vnto it, the ſame will attract the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> from his right place, and comming neerer the rocke, it will alter him much more, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ouer the ſame, it will attract the needle perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly, and being paſt, this needle will be freed by little and little from that diſturbance of his naturall inclination.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing declared the manifold cauſes of the variation of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> from his true and naturall angle of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the horizon; it followeth that we deliuer plainely how to diſcerne theſe euents when they ſhall fall out, which are known perfectly by hauing the true eleuation of the pole, where theſe matters ſhall be required.</p>
               <p>The rules and wayes how to know the eleuation of the pole in all places, is ſo perfectly ſet out by moſt Aſtronomers and writers of Nauigation, and ſo well knowne to all expert Pilots, that it is a thing needleſſe here to repeate them.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ingenious Pilot knowing the eleuation of the pole in ſome places of his voyage that he hath paſſed, by keeping a true, not a dead reckoning of his courſe in pricking his Card aright, and obſeruing the way with the logge-line, with other currants and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currants, will giue a very artificiall coniecture of the eleuation of the pole in that place where he is, though he ſee neither Sunne nor Starres.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1722:87"/>
Notwithſtanding becauſe the skilfull Pilots may be hindred in this kind of obſeruation, by the falling of the ſhip to Lee-wards, and by other extraordinary change of weather, and other diſturbances that may many wayes fall out at ſea, therefore I will onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one way out of the principals before deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereby he may at any time of the day, the Sunne ſhining, know the altitude of the pole.</p>
               <p>This thing is chiefly performed by knowing the true variation of the Compaſſe, which ſheweth the true meridian for that place, preſently ſeeke out the true Azimuth alſo, which is perfectly knowne by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Sunne vpon the limbe of the Compaſſe, by the furniture of the beame, before deſcribed, inſtantly take the altitude of the Sunne by the <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtaffe at ſea, or a large quadrant at land.</p>
               <p>The true Azimuth and Almicanter thus knowne, ſeeke the point where they croſſe the one the other in the Rete of the <hi>Mathematicall Iewell</hi> and <hi>Aſtrolabium Catholicum,</hi> then obſeruing the paralell of the Sunnes declination for that day, turne about the Rete of this inſtrument, vntill this paralell of the Sunnes declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be touched by the point, where theſe two circles of altitude and poſition meete, and then the horizon of the Rete will ſhew in the limbe the latitude of that place.</p>
               <p>The latitude of the pole for any place being knowne, the true angle of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> is manifeſt and apparant, as it is ſet downe and knowne by the XIII. chapter, in the chapter to know the angles of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the inſtrument, and in the table of the degrees of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle,</hi> anſwerable to euery eleuation of the pole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1722:87"/>
Now obſerue the degrees that the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> pointeth out in his ring in that place, and take the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theſe from the degrees of the true angle, and that is the variation of the <hi>Inclinatory-needle</hi> for that place.</p>

                     <hi>Of the matter of the Magneticall globe</hi> of the earth by the Needle.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T length we haue brought our ſhort Treatiſe <hi>Magneticall</hi> principally &amp; moſt profitably to declare the nature of the <hi>Directory</hi> and <hi>Inclinatory-needle,</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Terrella</hi> and <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> and towards the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth, and how the proportions and ſimilitude of their applications and conformities to both are alike and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Onely the <hi>Magneticall-needle</hi> being of a ſaeminine and ſequent ſubſtance, as hath bene demonſtrated in the VIII. XXI. and XXII. Chapters, doth behold the round <hi>Magnet,</hi> and the round Iron, with that point that is of the ſame nature and demonſtration that the pole is, which he followeth and affecteth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature <hi>Magneticall,</hi> that is in the Adamants themſelues, one towards the other, or of the needles one towards the other.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Magneticall-needle</hi> being freed from the <hi>Magneticall</hi> orbe of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and Iron, will haue that point of the needle that followed them directed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1722:90"/>
by the vertue <hi>Magneticall</hi> of the earth into a contrary prouince of polar preheminence.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Magneticall-needle</hi> doth conforme it ſelfe vnto the Earth in the ſame faſhion that the Adamant and <hi>Loadſtone</hi> it ſelfe doth; neither is it ſo ſeruiceable vnto the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth as he is vnto the <hi>Magnet</hi> and Iron, but is of a fellow-like ſpecies with the earth, as well as the Adamants themſelues are.</p>
               <p>Whereby I do gather that the matter of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth is not the ſame with theſe we know of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and iron, into whoſe bowels neuer any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the deepeſt mines, or other paſſages of fiſſurs and cauities, made by great Earth-quakes, euer yet deſcended to ſhew vnto vs any part of the earths interior ſubſtance <hi>Magneticall,</hi> and though I take the matter of the bowels of the earth to be <hi>Magnetical,</hi> yet the application of this <hi>Magneticall-needle</hi> demonſtrateth, that the <hi>Magnetical</hi> globe of the earths inward ſubſtance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth neither of ſollid <hi>Load ſtone,</hi> nor of iron-like mine or clay or ſuch like materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as they which haue thought themſelues moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Magneticall</hi> Philoſophy haue imagined.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe of the earth were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iron-like ſubſtance, then that point of the needle that affecteth a polar iuriſdiction, placed neere the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and the iron, would alſo, being applied vnto the earth, behold the ſame prouince and iuriſdiction polar, being directed by the vigor of the earths <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> orbe of like nature; but this is not ſo, as all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and may proue.</p>
               <p>Therefore I hold that the great <hi>Magnetical</hi> globe of the earth conſiſteth of a <hi>Magneticall</hi> ſubſtance vnknowne vnto vs, as alſo the bodies of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> globe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1722:90"/>
of the Moone and of the reſt do; and ſo conclude that the workes of God are moſt wonderfull, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſt finding out.</p>
               <p>But here before I end, I am to ſatisfie that I made promiſe of in the XII. Chapter, that I would ſhew my conceipt of the reaſon why the needle in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the aequator of the <hi>Magnet</hi> by the pole, to the aequator againe, ſhould make the circumuolution of an whole circle in turning about his foote, hauing paſſed a ſemicircle of the <hi>Terrella</hi> or <hi>Semiterrella,</hi> and would make another whole circle about the other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle of contrary nature with his other point.</p>
               <p>For to cleere this with the nature of the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, which is aduerſe one vnto the other. I would wiſh that you would conceiue and propound two globes of <hi>Magneticall</hi> nature and ſubſtance, as tender as clay, the one of them to be animated with the North and articke vertue at both poles, as <hi>Tab. XX. Fig. 3. aa,</hi> to turne to the North onely: and the other globe, with his poles <hi>Tab. XX. Fig. 3. bb</hi> to be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the antarticke power to moue to the South onely.</p>
               <p>Now if the globe of the earth, or of the <hi>Magnet-</hi>ſtone were made onely of one of theſe globes, then there would be a ſtrife betweene the poles of one of the globes, which ſhould behold his peculiar point, as if the pole <hi>a</hi> of the North vertue ſhould behold the North; the other pole <hi>a</hi> of the ſame globe, being of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke nature, would alſo ſtriue to behold the North, or at leaſt in their equality of power would rather reſpect Eaſt and Weſt, ſo that there would be no ſtability by the poles of ſuch kind of globes.</p>
